# N-ything Problem

A program to solve N-ything problem in 8 x 8 chess board using 3 kind of algorithm:
- Hill Climbing Algorithm
- Simulated Annealing Algorithm
- Genetic Algorithm

# Executing the Program

1. Enter the pawn that will be computed in the file src/test.txt.example
2. Run src/main.py using the command: **python main.py**
2. Enter the input file name (the default is test.txt.example)
3. Enter the algorithm that will be used.
4. For genetic algorithm, enter the number of genetic population and maximum iteration.
5. The result will be shown on the screen.
